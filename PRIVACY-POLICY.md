## Introduction

XDM (X Direct Messages) is a browser extension that provides a simplified interface for accessing X.com (formerly Twitter) direct messages. We take your privacy seriously and want to be transparent about our practices.

### What we DO:

- Access only the X.com/messages page to provide the simplified interface

### What we DO NOT do:

## Permissions

- **X.com host permission**: To access and modify the messages interface

These permissions are used solely for providing the core functionality of the extension and do not enable any data collection.

## Third-Party Services

The extension does not integrate with any third-party services. All functionality is handled locally in your browser and through direct interaction with X.com's official website.

## Changes to the Messages

The extension only modifies the visual presentation of X.com's messages interface. It does not:
- Alter the content of your messages
- Interfere with message sending or receiving
- Modify any X.com functionality
